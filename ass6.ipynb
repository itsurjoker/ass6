    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit called a class. It allows the data to be hidden and only accessible through well-defined methods, ensuring data integrity and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on representing essential features of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It allows developers to create simplified models of real-world objects, making it easier to understand and work with complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.Inheritance: Inheritance enables a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class). This mechanism promotes code reusability and allows for the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This concept allows flexibility and extensibility in the code by enabling different classes to be used interchangeably through common interfaces, even if they implement those interfaces differently."

    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), the term \"self\" refers to a special variable that is used to represent the instance of the class itself. It is a reference to the current object that is being manipulated or accessed within a class method. The use of \"self\" is a fundamental concept in OOP and is crucial for maintaining encapsulation, accessing instance variables, and calling other methods within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some reasons why \"self\" is used in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1.Accessing instance variables: In OOP, objects have their own unique state, which is defined by instance variables (also known as attributes or properties). By using \"self,\" you can access and modify the instance variables of the current object, ensuring that each object maintains its own data and doesn't interfere with the data of other objects of the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.Method invocation: Within a class, methods are defined to perform specific actions on the object's data. By using \"self,\" you can call other methods within the class, allowing for better organization and reusability of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.Encapsulation: Encapsulation is a core principle of OOP, which aims to hide the internal details of an object and expose only the necessary methods and attributes. By using \"self,\" you explicitly indicate that you are accessing the object's internal state, reinforcing the idea of encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.Clarity and readability: Using \"self\" explicitly in the code improves readability and makes it clear that you are referring to an instance variable or method of the current object."

    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a class (subclass or derived class) can inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (superclass or base class). In other words, the subclass can reuse the code and functionalities of the superclass, making the code more organized, modular, and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Single Inheritance:\n",
    "    Single inheritance refers to the scenario where a class inherits from only one superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, species):\n",
    "        self.species = species\n",
    "\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",

    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, breed):\n",
    "        super().__init__(\"Dog\")\n",

    "\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this example, the class Dog inherits from the class Animal.\n",
    "# Dog inherits the 'species' attribute and 'make_sound' method from Animal.\n",
    "# Dog can also override the 'make_sound' method with its own implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "    Multiple inheritance occurs when a class inherits from more than one superclass. This allows the subclass to acquire properties and methods from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Flyable:\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",
    "        return \"Flying\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Swimmable:\n",

    "class FlyingFish(Flyable, Swimmable):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this example, the class FlyingFish inherits from both Flyable and Swimmable.\n",
    "# As a result, FlyingFish can access the 'fly' method from Flyable and the 'swim' method from Swimmable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.Multi-level Inheritance:\n",
    "    Multi-level inheritance is a scenario where a class inherits from another class, which itself inherits from yet another class. It forms a chain of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "\n",
    "    def drive(self):\n",
    "        return \"Driving\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def honk(self):\n",
    "        return \"Honk honk!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class SportsCar(Car):\n",
    "    def accelerate(self):\n",
    "        return \"Vroom!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this example, the class SportsCar inherits from Car,\n",
    "# which, in turn, inherits from Vehicle.\n",
    "# SportsCar can access methods from both Car and Vehicle due to multi-level inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.Hierarchical Inheritance:\n",
    "    Hierarchical inheritance occurs when multiple classes inherit from a single superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Shape:\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Square(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, side):\n",
    "        self.side = side\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.side ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2"
